What is it?
===========

MP Multisite for Elgg allows you to run multiple separate Elgg 
sites off of the same install of the codebase, saving disk 
space and making administration a whole bunch easier.

Once installed, adding new Elgg sites is a matter of clicking 
on a button and entering in some details.

You are looking at the Elgg 1.7 Branch.

What can I do with it?
======================

You can do everything that you can do with Elgg, but with the 
ability to create new networks on demand. This will for example 
let you:

* Set up your own version of Ning!
* In your organisation or institution, easily set up Elgg 
  sites for each department.
* ... etc...
