INSTALLATION

1) Unzip the package on your web server.

2) Point your master domain at the contents of the install location on your web server (e.g /var/elggmulti)
	You will want to make sure that this location is behind some form of access restriction limiting it to only
	your organisation as it will contain the data root of all elgg domains.

3) Point any sub domains to the contents of the docroot folder, eg (/var/elggmulti/docroot)

4) Chmod 777 docroot/data - this is the default location for elgg multi domains.

5) Install schema/multisite_mysql.sql

6) Rename settings.example.php in docroot/elgg/engine/ to settings.php and configure:
	
		$CONFIG->multisite->dbuser = 'your username';
		$CONFIG->multisite->dbpass = 'password';
		$CONFIG->multisite->dbhost = 'host';

	as appropriate.		

7) Visit your master domain and configure your admin user

8) Begin configuring your sites!
